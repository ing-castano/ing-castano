# Hi there...I'm Martin CastaÃ±o ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer of Web Apps under Python, HTML5, Javascrypt and CSS languages as well as Flask and Bootstrap framework together with some Jinja syntax.

## Brief Intro
:soon: Udemy The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by *Dr. Angela Yu
Developer and Lead Instructor*
:soon: Harvard __CS50w__ Web __CS50w__ Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
:white_check_mark: Harvard __CS50x__ Introduction to Comouter Science
:white_check_mark: Master in Project Management  (2022)  
:white_check_mark: MBA  (2020)  
:white_check_mark: Engineer Bachelor Degree  (2016)  
I have an Engineer Bachelor degree from Argentina but none of it matters when I became a developer of Web Application Services that enjoy working at either the front-end or back-end of any project.

As I finish my MBA(2020), nearly all my recent projects have been around entrepreneurs scaling their business models and getting into this world of technology!

Later on, I realized that to leverage my career I should focus on team work & best management practices so I have recently done my Master on Project Management in Spain (2021). I have also took CS50 on 2022 (Harvard online Edx extension) and still taking more edx and udemy programming courses to master my programming habilities.

I am actually looking foward to collaborate and hopefully get a full remote job in the US as a foreign contractor. If you have a project or work proposal, please don't hesistate to contact me on:
