I have an Engineer Bachelor degree from Argentina but none of it matters when I became a developer of Web Application Services that enjoy working at either the front-end or back-end of any project.

As I finish my MBA(2020), nearly all my recent projects have been around entrepreneurs scaling their business models and getting into this world of technology!

Later on, I realized that to leverage my career I should focus on team work & best management practices so I have recently done my Master on Project Management in Spain (2021). I have also took CS50 on 2022 (Harvard online Edx extension) and still taking more edx and udemy programming courses to master my programming habilities.

I am actually looking foward to collaborate and hopefully get a full remote job in the US as a foreign contractor. If you have a project or work proposal, please don't hesistate to contact me on:
